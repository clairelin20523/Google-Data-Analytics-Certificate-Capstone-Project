The data used will be the *divvy* public dataset. The topic is reguarding a bike share company in Chicago called Cyclistic. The bike share program generalizes the customers into two types of riders, <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> that buys single-ride passes and/or full-day passes, and <span style = \"color:cornflowerblue;\"> annual members </span> that buys annual memberships. It has been concluded that annual memberships bring more profit to the company. With many customers already using this program, the company wants advertising strategies to transform casual riders into annual members.\n### Scenario\nThe goal is to use the previous 12 months of trip data to analyze the differences between <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> and <span style = \"color:cornflowerblue;\"> annual members </span>. Determine the key aspects needed for <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> to buy an annual membership according to data insights. Use key conclusions to develop new and effective marketing strategies in order to convert <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> to <span style = \"color:cornflowerblue;\"> annual members </span> and present the strategies.\n##### Questions to answer:\n1. What are the differences between the two rider groups\n2. What is needed to transform <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> into <span style = \"color:cornflowerblue;\"> annual members </span>\n3.

Monthly memberships could be useful for customers to try commuting to work/school using the bike share program, giving them a test period and allowing flexibility.\n2. **Incorporating a rewards system:** A rewards system that could provide for certain discounts/deals could increase customers' comeback rates. Customers could collect points from using the service each time, increasing the sense of engagement. This system would encourage customers to use the service more often which would more likely result in a purchase of an annual membership.\n3. **Adding extra stations:** Adding additional stations near popular spots among <span style = \"color:salmon;\"> casual riders </span> could also increase their use of the service which might turn them into <span style = \"color:cornflowerblue;\"> annual members </span> (`popular_stations` dataframe from above).
